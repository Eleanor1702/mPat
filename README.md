# mPat

### What is mPat

The mPat system was build to give patients a better insight regarding their waiting time in emergency departments. Patients generally do not know how long they have to wait until being treated or even how many patients will be treated before them. The mPat platform consists of a REST API and a frontend (called Backoffice) which manages two types of patients with different priorities. Additionally, mPat offers a mobile application which the patients can use to connect to the Backoffice and receive information about their stay at the emergency department like their position in the waiting queue or the estimated remaining waiting time.

The following sections provide a basic overview of the mPat platform and how to develop and run the platform. For further details please refer to the bachelor's thesis of this project.

### ‚≠êÔ∏è Main features of mPat

- Authentication using credentials stored with organisations

- Structuring of organisations in departments

- Management of patients for each department

- Calculation of the next possible patient using a scheduling algorithm

- Selection of next patient manually or via the algorithm

- Connection of the mPat mobile application with a certain organisation

- Visualization of patient waiting time and queue position in mobile application when connected

### üß∞ Frameworks and technologies

- Database: MySQL version 8.0.19

- Backend: ASP.NET Core version 3.1 using C#

- Frontend: React version 16.13.1 using Node.js created with create-react-app

- Mobile Application: React Native version 0.62.2 and Expo 38.0.8 using Node.js

### üìê Overview of the architecture

##### ‚öôÔ∏è Backend


The backend of mPat is a REST API implemented in ASP.NET Core using C# and is connected to the MySQL database using a MySQL connector for C#. It provides its services via JSON responses and HTTP which the frontend and mobile application consumes.

The backend is divided in three layers:

- Controllers: The controllers are responsible for providing the HTTP endpoints for the mobile app and frontend to consume. The REST API currently offers controllers for authentication, departments, patients, and the mobile app.

- Services: The service layer consists of the business logic of the mPat backend as well as the access to the database.

- Models: In the REST API models are data containers for the results from the database as well as for the serialization and deserialization of data from and to JSON.

##### üåê Frontend

The frontend is a React single-page application. In single-page applications all static resources are initially loaded on the first request and the content of the page is replaced using JavaScript according to the interaction of the user. Therefore, the page itself does not have to be reloaded each time when interacting with it which increases the responsiveness of the application. To load data from the REST API, the frontend uses AJAX requests which is a technology to execute HTTP requests using JavaScript.

React applications are composed of several components. At the root of the mPat frontend application is the **App** component which stores all the necessary state of the frontend. According to its current state, the **App** component shows the respective **Screen** component to the user. **Screen** components consist of further components depending on their complexity and needs.

##### üì± Mobile Application

The mobile application is based on React as well by using the React Native framework. It is therefore similarly structured to the frontend. The biggest difference is the navigation of screens which in the mobile application is not managed by the root component but by a library called **React Navigation**. The library employs native functionalities of the mobile operating system to switch between screens depending on the interaction of the user. An additional difference between the frontend and the mobile application is no global state in the root component. Each screen manages its own state and shares it through sending the necessary data to a different screen when switching to it.

Other than that, the mobile application consists of **Screen** components similar to the frontend with one root component that sets of the navigation through the previously mentioned library.

### üõ† Development Instructions

#### üóÇÔ∏è MySQL Setup
---

##### Windows

>  During the setup, the windows firewall might be triggered several times. Please click on **allow** in every case.

- XAMPP:
    - Download [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html) for an easy access to MySQL. During the install only select MySQL and Apache.

    - After the installation, start XAMPP and toggle the start button for Apache and MySQL.

- Setting up MySQL:
    - Open the start menu and search for `cmd`.

    - In the **cmd**, navigate to the following folder by inputing:
		```
        cd {pathToXAMPP}\mysql\bin
        ```

	- Now, use the following command to log in as **root** in MySQL:
		```
        mysql -uroot
        ```

	- You should be now inside the MySQL/MariaDB Command Line Interface. It could look somewhat like this:
	    ```
	    C:\xampp\mysql\bin>mysql -u root
        Welcome to the MariaDB monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
        Your MariaDB connection id is 8
        Server version: 10.4.14-MariaDB mariadb.org binary distribution

        Copyright (c) 2000, 2018, Oracle, MariaDB Corporation Ab and others.

        Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the current input statement.

        MariaDB [(none)]>
	    ```

	- Now you can enter the following command to create a user called **developer** with the password **developer**:
		```sql
        CREATE USER 'developer'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'developer';
        ```

	- **[optional]** Check whether the user exists or not, enter the following command:
		```sql
        SELECT host, user, password FROM mysql.user;
        ```

	- Afterwards, the user **developer** needs to be granted all privileges. This can be done by entering the following command:
		```sql
        GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'developer'@'localhost';
        ```

	- Then exit the MySQL/MariaDB Command Line Interface by inputing the command:
        ```sql
        exit
	    ```

	- In the same directory, execute the following command to set the Schema: **(Replace {pathToBackendProject} with the correct path)**
	    ```
		mysql -u developer -p < {pathToBackendProject}\DDL\Schema.ddl
        ```

	- You will be asked for the Password, which is `developer`.

	- If no errors occurred, then the database is set for development. This **cmd** window can be closed.

### üîß Important configuration

##### üåê Frontend port

The default port of the frontend is **3000** which can be modified through the setting of an environment variable before running the frontend:

- Windows:

	```
	SET PORT=8000
	```

- MacOS:

	```
	export PORT=8000
	```

##### ‚öôÔ∏è Backend Port

The default port of the backend is **5000** which can be modified through the property file of the backend located at **{pathToBackendProject}\Properties\launchSettings.json**. It contains a setting called **applicationUrl** which specifies how the backend can be accessed. After changing the port of the backend, **all AJAX requests** being executed in the frontend as well as the mobile application **must** be modified as well.

##### üóÇ Database changes

The database schema is managed through a DDL file located at **{pathToBackendProject}\DDL\Schema.ddl**. Database changes should therefore be implemented in this schema file. Afterwards, the database has to be recreated by connecting to the MySQL/MariaDB Command Line Interface and executing:

```
DROP DATABASE mPat;
```

Then the schema can be imported again as outlined in the **MySQL Setup** section of this README.

### ü©∫ Current state of the application

In its current form, mPat is fully working and has no known bugs. There are several places that could be extended however:

- Proper notification system: Through the usage of notifications, the user experience could be greatly improved for users. Notifications could be sent to the mobile device whenever the remaining waiting time reaches a certain threshold (e.g. only 3 minutes are remaining), or the position in the queue increases or decreases.

- Allowing patients to cancel their visit through the app: Currently patients can not cancel their visit at the emergency department on their own. The app could offer the possibility to cancel the visit if it is currently connected with an organisation.

- Storage of the current patient ID in the app: The mobile application currently does not store the patient ID in persistent storage but only in-memory. Consequently, if a user completely closes the application or restarts the mobile device, a new connection to the organisation has to be established when opening the mPat application again. React Native offers capabilities to store the ID in persistent storage which could be employed for this feature.

For further potential work please refer to the **Discussion** section of the bachelor's thesis.
